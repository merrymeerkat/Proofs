\section*{Proof 1}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:3Divides4ton-1}
	If $n$ is a nonnegative integer, then $3 \mid (4^n-1)$.
\end{thm}


\begin{proof}

We will prove theorem 1 by induction.

Firstly, we test it for the base case of n = 0. We thus have:

$$3 \mid (4^0-1) $$
$$= 3 \mid (1-1) $$
$$= 3 \mid (0). $$

Since 0 is divisible by three (zero is divisible by any integer apart from itself), the theorem holds for the base case.

Now, assuming that the theorem holds for some $n \in \N$, we need to prove that it holds for $n + 1$ as well. For $n+1$, we have:

$$P(n+1) = 4^{n+1} - 1 .$$

Re-arranging it, we get:

$$4^{n+1} - 1 $$
$$=  4 \times 4^n - 1 $$
$$=  3(4^n) + 4^n - 1. $$

We are assuming that $4^n - 1$ is divisible by 3. Therefore, we can re-write this term $3k$, with $k\in\N{_0}$. Then, we get

$$P (n+1) =  3(4^n) + 3k $$
$$ = 3(4^n + k) $$

We thus see that if P(n) is divisible by 3, P(n+1) must also be divisible by 3. Theorem 1 holds.

\end{proof}
